## Week 1 - Project Introduction & Setup

### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project explores how the removal of fuel subsidies in Nigeria is impacting food prices and the cost of living for everyday Nigerians. Over the next few weeks, Iâ€™ll analyze data to uncover trends, regional impacts, and public sentiment related to these price changes.

### ðŸŽ¯ Week 1 Goals

- Define the problem and project scope  
- Collect and organize relevant datasets on fuel and food prices (2022â€“2025)  
- Set up a clean, organized project structure  
- Perform initial data cleaning and exploration  
- Create first visualizations comparing fuel and food prices over time

### ðŸ—‚ Folder Structure

To keep the project organized and reproducible, I structured the repo like this:

- `/data` - raw and cleaned datasets  
- `/notebooks` - Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization  
- `/outputs` - charts, tables, and final results  
- `/docs` - project plans, notes, and this README

- **National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) Nigeria** - fuel and food price data  
- **Online marketplaces and reports** - for supplementary price information

### ðŸ”œ Next Steps

In **Week 2**, Iâ€™ll dive deeper into analyzing specific food items and regional differences. Stay tuned!

Feel free to explore the `/notebooks` folder to follow along with my data cleaning and early visualizations.
